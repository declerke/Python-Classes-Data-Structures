# 🐍 Python Classes, Inheritance, and Data Structures (40-Question Test)

This repository contains the completed solutions to a 40-question coding test designed to rigorously practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and intermediate data structure applications in Python.

## 🎯 Focus Areas

The assignment was structured into four core sections to test a comprehensive understanding of Python's intermediate features:

| Section | Focus | Key Concepts Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Section 1: Basic Classes (Q1–Q10)** | Class definition, attributes, instance methods (`__init__`), static methods, encapsulation (private attributes). |
| **Section 2: Inheritance (Q11–Q20)** | Single Inheritance, method overriding, using `super()`, abstract base classes (via `NotImplementedError`), and implementing polymorphic behavior.  |
| **Section 3: Data Structures (Q21–Q30)** | Practical implementation of Python's core data structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples) within a class context, including FIFO (Queue) and LIFO (Stack) logic.  |
| **Section 4: Intermediate Class Applications (Q31–Q40)** | Advanced class design, using objects as attributes, dictionary/list comprehensions for analysis (VotingSystem, DataAnalyzer), and handling complex logic (Matrix addition). |

## 📁 Repository Structure
